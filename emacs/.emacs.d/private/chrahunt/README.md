# Personal spacemacs layer

For more information see [LAYERS](https://develop.spacemacs.org/doc/LAYERS.html).

Separate local packages are for things that seem solid and mostly
generic. My personal layer is for configuring packages, where that
configuration is unlikely to change. `.spacemacs` is for configuration
I'm still figuring out.
